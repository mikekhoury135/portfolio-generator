# Node.js Portfolio Generator

Generate dynamic webpages based on user CLI input using Nodejs and Inquirerjs. Made as a boot camp coding challenge for Week 9.

## Description

Using an asynchronous approach, this application captures user input in the command-line and uses the file system to write this data to an HTML file in the distribution folder. The data we are capturing is specifically pertaining to a developer portfolio.

### Dependencies

* Run 'npm install' to install Inquirer as it is required for the command-line application to function.

### Executing program

* Begin by typing 'node app.js' in the command-line ensuring you are in the correct directory.
* Fill out the required prompts and add as many projects as you'd like.
* When finished, your HTML and CSS file will be located in the 'dist' folder.
* NOTE: RUNNING THE APPLICATION AGAIN WILL OVERWRITE THE CURRENT FILES IN THE DIST FOLDER.
